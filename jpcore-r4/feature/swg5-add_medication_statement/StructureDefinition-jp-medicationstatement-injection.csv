","投与タイミング","投与タイミングを記録する。","Describes the occurrence of an event that may occur multiple times. Timing schedules are used for specifying when events are expected or requested to occur, and may also be used to represent the summary of a past or ongoing event.  For simplicity, the definitions of Timing components are expressed as 'future' events, but such components can also be used to describe historic or ongoing events.

A Timing schedule can be a list of events and/or criteria for when the event happens, which can be expressed in a structured form and/or as a code. When both event and a repeating specification are provided, the list of events should be understood as an interpretation of the information in the repeat structure.","The timing schedule for giving the medication to the patient. This  data type allows many different expressions. For example: ""Every 8 hours""; ""Three times a day""; ""1/2 an hour before breakfast for 10 days from 23-Dec 2011:""; ""15 Oct 2013, 17 Oct 2013 and 1 Nov 2013"".  Sometimes, a rate can imply duration when expressed as total volume / duration (e.g.  500mL/2 hours implies a duration of 2 hours).  However, when rate doesn't imply duration (e.g. 250mL/hour), then the timing.repeat.duration is needed to convey the infuse over time period.","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"Dosage.timing",0,1,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}

If the rate is intended to change over time, depending on local rules/regulations, each change should be captured as a new version of the MedicationRequest with an updated rate, or captured with a new MedicationRequest with the new rate.It is possible to specify a rate over time (for example, 100 ml/hour) using either the rateRatio and rateQuantity.  The rateQuantity approach requires systems to have the capability to parse UCUM grammer where ml/hour is included rather than a specific ratio where the time is specified as the denominator.
